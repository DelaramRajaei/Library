Dear Prof./Dr. Lastname,
I hope this message finds you well. I am Firstname Lastname, a student pursuing Master's/PhD in Computer Science at the University of Windsor, [Canada], with a specialization in the Artificial Intelligence Stream, under the supervision of Dr. Hossein Fani. I am writing this message to kindly request your assistance as an internal reader for my MSc/PhD thesis proposal.
My thesis centers on [4-5 sentences about the contributions]. We have also contributed Z (http://github.com/fani-lab/z), a toolkit to support the reproducibility of our research.
Our early results have been accepted at the W conference/journal (https://doi.org/***), and I am in the process of preparing a resource paper for SIGIR24 and a journal manuscript by the end of the Fall 2023 semester.
I would be honoured to extend an invitation to you as the internal reader of my thesis/dissertation evaluation committee, given your expertise in neural models and deep learning. Attached, you will find the published paper for your reading.
I am planning to schedule the thesis proposal in early September, and the thesis defence in early January, and I would greatly appreciate hearing about your interest and availability.
Sincerely,
Firstname Lastname
MSc/PhD Student
```

4- Wait for a response; if not accepted, send an invitation email to the top 2, ...
5- If accepted, send a `thank you` email like

```
Dear X,
We appreciate your [quick reply] and acceptance of the invitation, and we are excited to have you in the evaluation committee member.

I will coordinate the proposal schedule with you soon.
 
Sincerely,
```

6- Timing 
Send date-time options, as wide/many as possible (you can use [`doodle`](https://doodle.com/en/)), to agree on a date-time spot for all committee members, considering `10 DAYS DELAY` by the graduate secretary of the school, like:

```
Dear X,
I sincerely appreciate your willingness to join my committee.

To coordinate our meeting, I've found several time slots on September 14th and 15th, each spanning from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm.
Please kindly inform me of your preferred availability within these windows for both days.

Also, if none of these time slots suit your schedule, please do not hesitate to inform me, and I will gladly work to propose alternative options.

Sincerely,
```

7- Admin Forms

When agreed on the date-time slot, there are two forms (one pdf and one word document) to be submitted to the graduate secretary;

**Word Document:** First one should be completed after the agreement on the time with your name, abstract and general info about the proposal. You should send this form to the secretary by attaching the confirmation emails on the timing from your supervisor, internal reader, and external reader.

**PDF Form:** Second one should be signed by you, your supervisor, internal reader, and external reader when you agreed on the time. This form which is the committee form has a special submission instruction which has been mentioned inside the form.

# Defence 
1- Availability Inquiry 

After consulting with Hossein, contact your committee members one by one to inquire about their availability during your proposed defense date. Ideally, you should start with the member who has the busiest schedule. With a sample as follows:
```
Dear Dr. X,

Hello, I hope this message finds you well.
I am reaching out to inquire about your availability during the first two weeks of January 2024. I am currently in the process of planning the defense of my thesis and am aiming to schedule it within this timeframe. Understanding your busy schedule, I wanted to coordinate with you first as a valued member of my thesis committee.
I would greatly appreciate it if you could share any potential dates and times that would suit you during this period.

I look forward to your response and thank you in advance for your time and consideration.
Kindest regards,
Your Name, Lastname
```
Do the same procedure for all committee members, find an overlap between their availabilites, and finalize it with Hossein.

2- Securing a Defense Chair:

After finilazing the proposed date/dates for the defense, prepare a list of suggested chairs and go over it with Hossein. After making the choice, you can send an email as follows with your suggested date/time:
```
Dear Prof./Dr. Lastname,
I hope this message finds you well. I am Firstname Lastname, a student pursuing Master's/PhD in Computer Science at the University of Windsor, [Canada], with a specialization in the Artificial Intelligence Stream, under the supervision of Dr. Hossein Fani. I am writing this message to kindly request your assistance as a defense chair for my MSc/PhD thesis defense.
My thesis centers on [4-5 sentences about the contributions]. We have also contributed Z (http://github.com/fani-lab/z), a toolkit to support the reproducibility of our research.
Our early results have been accepted at the W conference/journal (https://doi.org/***), and I am in the process of preparing a resource paper for W conference and a journal manuscript by the end of the Winter 2024 semester.
I would be honoured to extend an invitation to you as the chair of my thesis defense session. Attached, you will find the published paper for your reading.
I am planning to schedule the thesis defense in early January ( January 9th or January 11th  ,  1-2 pm). I would greatly appreciate hearing about your interest and availability.
Sincerely,
Firstname Lastname
MSc/PhD Student
```
If the chosen person agree, you can proceed to the next step, otherwise you have to contact the next suggested chair on your list.

3- Admin Forms: 

When agreed on the date-time slot, there are two forms (one pdf and one word document) to be submitted to the graduate secretary.

**Word Document:** Should be completed after the agreement on the time with your name, abstract and general info about the thesis. You should send this form to the secretary.

**Thesis Defense Request Form:** Fill this form with your name, proposal date, suggested defense date/time and names of your committee member and sign it. Then send the file as an email to Hossein in order to get his approval. Afterwards, you can proceed and send this to other members one by one. The template for that email can be as follows:

```
Dear Dr.X,

Hello, I hope this email finds you well.
Please find attached MSc Thesis Defense Request Form to this email in order to secure the time spot from the department of Computer Science. Based on the availabilities that you kindly provided, we suggest January 11th, 1 pm.
Finally, since I am still doing the final touches of my thesis writeup, how many days before the defense would be ideal for you to receive my final draft for reading?
Looking forward to hearing back from you and thank you for your time and consideration.

Kindest Regards,
Your Name
