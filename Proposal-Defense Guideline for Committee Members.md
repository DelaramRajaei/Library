Dear Prof./Dr. Lastname,
I hope this message finds you well. I am Firstname Lastname, a student pursuing Master's/PhD in Computer Science at the University of Windsor, [Canada], with a specialization in the Artificial Intelligence Stream, under the supervision of Dr. Hossein Fani. I am writing this message to kindly request your assistance as an internal reader for my MSc/PhD thesis proposal.
My thesis centers on [4-5 sentences about the contributions]. We have also contributed Z (http://github.com/fani-lab/z), a toolkit to support the reproducibility of our research.
Our early results have been accepted at the W conference/journal (https://doi.org/***), and I am in the process of preparing a resource paper for SIGIR24 and a journal manuscript by the end of the Fall 2023 semester.
I would be honoured to extend an invitation to you as the internal reader of my thesis/dissertation evaluation committee, given your expertise in neural models and deep learning. Attached, you will find the published paper for your reading.
I am planning to schedule the thesis proposal in early September, and the thesis defence in early January, and I would greatly appreciate hearing about your interest and availability.
Sincerely,
Firstname Lastname
MSc/PhD Student

4- Wait for a response; if not accepted, send an invitation email to the top 2, ...
5- If accepted, send a `thank you` email like

```
Dear X,
We appreciate your [quick reply] and acceptance of the invitation, and we are excited to have you in the evaluation committee member.

I will coordinate the proposal schedule with you soon.
 
Sincerely,
```

6- Timing 
Send date-time options, as wide/many as possible (you can use [`doodle`](https://doodle.com/en/)), to agree on a date-time spot for all committee members, considering `10 DAYS DELAY` by the graduate secretary of the school, like:

```
Dear X,
I sincerely appreciate your willingness to join my committee.

To coordinate our meeting, I've found several time slots on September 14th and 15th, each spanning from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm.
Please kindly inform me of your preferred availability within these windows for both days.

Also, if none of these time slots suit your schedule, please do not hesitate to inform me, and I will gladly work to propose alternative options.

Sincerely,
```

7- Admin Forms

When agreed on the date-time slot, there are two forms (one pdf and one word document) to be submitted to the graduate secretary;

**Word Document:** First one should be completed after the agreement on the time with your name, abstract and general info about the proposal. You should send this form to the secretary by attaching the confirmation emails on the timing from your supervisor, internal reader, and external reader.

**PDF Form:** Second one should be signed by you, your supervisor, internal reader, and external reader when you agreed on the time. This form which is the committee form has a special submission instruction which has been mentioned inside the form.
